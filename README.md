How does long-term alcohol consumption, measured objectively by hair ethyl glucuronide (hEtG), influence cardiac remodeling after radiofrequency ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation?

Research Question & Hypotheses

This project investigates how long-term alcohol consumption, measured objectively using hair ethyl glucuronide (hEtG), influences cardiac remodeling and outcomes after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Previous studies rely on self-reported alcohol intake, which can be unreliable; hEtG provides a more accurate biomarker of chronic consumption.
I hypothesize that patients with higher hEtG levels (>7 pg/mg) will exhibit greater structural and functional cardiac remodeling, as indicated by higher left atrial volume index (LAVI) and elevated biomarkers of atrial wall stress (NT-proBNP, MR-proANP). I also hypothesize that higher alcohol exposure may increase the need for repeat ablation within one year.
To test these hypotheses, we plan to use linear regression for continuous outcomes (with log-transformation where appropriate), Mann-Whitney U or t-tests for group comparisons, and odds ratios with chi-square/Fisher’s exact tests for binary outcomes such as re-ablation. Analyses will account for age, sex, BMI, SBP, type of AF, and heart failure as covariates, and p-values will be corrected for multiple testing. Visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots (facet gender) will aid in understanding data distribution and relationships.

Data Description

The dataset originates from a clinical cohort of AF patients undergoing RFA, with measurements taken before and one year after the procedure. Key variables include:
Exposure: Hair ethyl glucuronide (hEtG), a biomarker of long-term alcohol intake.
Structural remodeling: Left atrial volume index (LAVI), including LAVmax and LAVmin.
Functional remodeling: NT-proBNP and MR-proANP levels as markers of cardiac wall stress and atrial function.
Outcomes: Ejection fraction (EF), left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF), and need for repeat ablation within one year.
Covariates: Age, sex, BMI, SBP, type of AF, history of heart failure
